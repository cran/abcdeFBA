Version History

#------------------------------------------------#
version 0.1
* first public release

#-----------------------------------------------#
version 0.2
* Fixed bug in double knockout result processor.
* Fixed labeling error in graph generated from double knockout processing.
* Included case for blocked reactions in Perturbation Analysis the absence of which caused crashes when the function was run on blocked reactions.
* The return of the flux distribution matrix generated during Perturbation Analysis has been made optional.
* added argument in Perturbation Analysis to observe fluxes other than the default objective flux in the graph.
* the Exhaustive_single_deletion function has a new argument to pass a subset of reactions for deletion.
* the PDF graph output generated by Exhaustive_single_deletion has been made optional via function argument.
* FLUX_VARIABILITY_ANALYSIS can now be performed on a subset of reactions instead of the whole reaction set.(Speed-up for the impatient.)
* removed a redundant function designed to quickly detect abnormalities in flux distribution of wild-type and mutant
* Added Gene_del, a function implementing multiple-gene deletions by interpreting boolean relations encoded in GPR.
* Added Gene Annotations, GPR information to models included in package dataset.
* updated documentation. 
#------------------------------------------------#
version 0.3

* The FLD_matrix in Perturbation Analysis does have the WT fluxes in the first column anymore, it is only the ramp fluxes.
